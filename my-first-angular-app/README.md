 ## Tutorial Section 1: Setup

 Recall, we need to have Node and Anfulat installed. Make sure to install NodeJS if you haven't already. Then you can install the Angular CLI. The Latest, which we are using for this tutorial is `21.1.2`

 For this project, we creat a new application using `ng new my-first-angular-app`.
